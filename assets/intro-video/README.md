# Placeholder Intro Video

This file serves as a placeholder for the intro video.

## IMPORTANT: Replace This File

You must replace this `intro.mp4` file with your actual cinematic intro video for CHAKRAVYUH Round 3.

### Video Requirements:

- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- Duration: 30-60 seconds (or as needed)
- Theme: Epic, cinematic, Mahabharata-inspired
- Audio: Optional background music

### How to Replace:
1. Create your intro video
2. Name it `intro.mp4`
3. Place it in this directory: `assets/intro-video/intro.mp4`
4. The video will automatically play when users first visit the website

### Video Behavior:
- Plays fullscreen on first website visit
- Has a "Skip Intro" button
- Auto-redirects to home after completion
- Won't replay on refresh (uses localStorage)

**Note**: Until you replace this file, the intro video feature won't work properly. The website will still function, but the intro screen may show errors.
